 <br><br>
How did I get into programming: <br>
Even as a teenager, I was fascinated by programming and always admired those who could do it. 
Inspired by the movie "Hackers," I always wanted to learn it myself. 
Due to certain circumstances, my dream of programming would only come true in November 2023. 
That's when I started my course in HTML and Java.

🤖 Fun fact: I'm a creative chaos.🤖
